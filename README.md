Please note that these are just a few of many scripts inside of the game. I cannot really send everything.

The stone trajectory branch shows some of the scripts involved in forming the stone's path while it skips as seen in the video. 

The Ripples branch shows all the module scripts involved in creating the ripples. 

The user Interface branch shows the back-bone modules for creating User interfaces.
